# Tesi: SVILUPPO DI UN ALGORITMO DI SEGMENTAZIONE PER LA MISURA DELLE PROPRIETA' GEOMETRICHE DELLE MACCHIE CUTANEE

Universit√† degli Studi di Padova, Corso di Laurea in Ingegneria Elettronica, DEI, 17 Aprile 2000.

In these repository I have collected what I did, some years ago, when developed my thesis.

* [f-tesi-latex][thesis-latex] 

In this folder can be found the Latex source and the Postscript result.
Unfortunately it's only in Italian.

[thesis-latex]: https://github.com/mzonta/f-tesi-unipd/tree/master/f-tesi-latex

* [f-tesi-sw][thesis-sw]

In this folder can be found the code developed in Matlab and the conversion to Octave I made in 2015.
They are the routines I wrote to implement the different part of the algorithm described in the thesis.
I know, it's not well organized, but most of the functions are quite well documented.
